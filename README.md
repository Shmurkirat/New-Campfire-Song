New-Campfire-Song

It's a new campfire song so sing along!
We're all out here
in the summer
eating smores 
around the campfire
Little do we know whats about to come
Oh wait, thats right, its the campfire song!
.
.
.
Now that we're here
lets eat pizza
with some watermelon
and some koolaid
and some candy
but make sure that you...
Don't vomit from overeating!
As we sing along to the campfire song!
.
.
.
Know your limits as we're all gathered
because calculus is hard
limits help use to find dervivitives!
and then come integerals 
which have no inititive!
